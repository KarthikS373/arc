# Introduction [](#introduction)

Welcome to Arc, a versatile and production ready smart contract engine that redefines the experience of a smart contract developer. Arc combines exceptional speed, security and intelligence to provide a seamless experience develop, audit and deploy smart contracts. Arc combines powerful tools inspired by Remix, Third Web and OpenZeppelin Wizard enhanced by a finely-tuned AI model to elevate every stage of the development process. With Arc, developers can streamline the entire contract development lifecycle and fasttrack their development journey. Drawing inspiration from leading blockchain development frameworks, Arc not only simplifies complex tasks but also enhances the precision and quality of the smart contracts.

# Motivation [](#motivation)

The motivation behind Arc is to address the common challenges faced by smart contract developers, such as security vulnerabilities, complexity of development, and inefficiencies in the deployment process. By leveraging advanced AI and providing a comprehensive suite of tools, Arc aims to make smart contract development more accessible, secure, and efficient, ultimately fostering innovation and growth within the blockchain ecosystem.

# Tech stack [](#tech)

Arc is built using a robust tech stack to ensure performance, reliability, and scalability:

- Next.js
- Solidity
- Slither
- Hardhat
- Foundry
- AI models

# Core Features [](#core)

Arc is packed with a wide array of features designed to enhance every aspect of smart contract development.
Here is a detailed breakdown:

#### 1. **AI powered IDE**

Arc provides an intelligent development environment for solidity where you can write smart contracts from scratch or use pre-built templates. The AI-driven autocompletion suggests code as you type, speeding up the process and reducing errors
